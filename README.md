Generate Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from given Point Cloud Data

A Digital Elevation Model(DEM) refers to a representation of the earth's surface, including features such as vegetation, buildings, bridges etc.

DEM often comprises much of the raw dataset, which may have been acquired through techniques such as photogrammetry, LiDAR, land, surveying, etc.

A Digital Terrain Model(DTM) on the other hand is a filtered version of this surface & hence can be a post-processed version of what was originally a DEM.

DTM provides a bare earth model, devoid of landscape features.

Sample Output for given Point Cloud Data:
